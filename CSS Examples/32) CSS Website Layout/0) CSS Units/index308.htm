<!-- CSSÂ Units-->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- CSS has several different units for expressing a length. -->
<!-- -->
<!-- 

Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

-->
<!-- --> 
<!--

Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

 -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- Set different length values, using px (pixels):-->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- 

Note: A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.

For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.

There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.
