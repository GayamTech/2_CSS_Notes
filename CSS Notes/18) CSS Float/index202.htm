<h2>With clear</h2>
<div class="div3">div3</div>
<div class="div4">div4 - Here, clear: left; moves div4 down below the floating div3. The value "left" clears elements floated to the left. You can also clear "right" and "both".</div>

<!-- -->
<!-- The clear Property-->
<!-- -->
<!-- --> 
<!--When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property. -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.-->
<!-- --> 
<!-- -->
<!-- 

The clear property can have one of the following values:

none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default

left - The element is pushed below left floated elements

right - The element is pushed below right floated elements

both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements

inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

-->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!--When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page. --> 
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!--This example clears the float to the left. Here, it means that the <div2> element is pushed below the left floated <div1> element:  -->
