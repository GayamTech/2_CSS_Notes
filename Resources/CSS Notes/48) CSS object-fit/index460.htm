The CSS object-fit Property :


The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.

This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible".

Look at the following image from Paris. This image is 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels high:

<!-- 

However, if we style the image above to be half its width (200 pixels) and same height (300 pixels), it will look like this:

-->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- --> 
<!-- 

We see that the image is being squished to fit the container of 200x300 pixels (its original aspect ratio is destroyed).






Here is where the object-fit property comes in. The object-fit property can take one of the following values:

fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit


contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension


cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit


none - The image is not resized


scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain
